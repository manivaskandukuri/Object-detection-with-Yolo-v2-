YOLO ("you only look once") is a popular deep learning-based algorithm with high accuracy and good real-time performance. In yolo, object detection is framed as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Yolo-v2 is the improvised
